Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe model demonstrated that incorporating regime-switching dynamics into risk assessment provides more accurate predictions during market stress periods.",

The strategy was tested across 15 years of historical data.\n\n## Results\n\n- Annual return: 14.3% vs 9.8% benchmark\n- Sharpe ratio: 1.42\n- Maximum drawdown: -18.7%\n- Win rate: 58%\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nTransaction costs and slippage significantly impact real-world performance. The strategy performs best in trending markets and underperforms during range-bound periods.",
